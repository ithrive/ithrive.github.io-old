                <p>
                    Pilates is a system of body conditioning that emphasises a flexible spine and strong core while fostering a deep mind-body awareness.

                <p>
                    Founder, Joseph Pilates, defined it as 
                    <span class="quote">"a way to completely and thoroughly unify the body, mind and spirit."</span>
